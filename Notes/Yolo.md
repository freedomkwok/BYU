üîπ 1. Bottleneck
    A bottleneck is a type of structure that compresses and then expands the feature channels. It‚Äôs common in ResNet, YOLOv5‚Äôs C3, and other deep nets.
    Input ‚Üí Conv1x1 (reduce channels)
        ‚Üí Conv3x3 (main processing)
        ‚Üí Conv1x1 (expand channels back)

        ‚Üí (Optional residual connection)
Key Properties:
Uses learned convolutions
Compresses then expands
Designed for efficiency + expressiveness
Channels and spatial size are independent
Used in ResNet, CSP, YOLOv5 (C3)
Think of it as a ‚Äúsmart reshaper‚Äù that learns what to keep and expand

üîπ 2. Split (used in C2f)
    Split means dividing the input feature map into parts (along the channel axis), processing each part (e.g. with Conv or Bottleneck), and then concatenating them back together.
    üì¶ Architecture in C2f:
    Input ‚Üí Split into N chunks
      ‚Üí Each chunk ‚Üí small block (like a Conv/Bottleneck)
      ‚Üí Concat all processed chunks
      ‚Üí Final Conv
üéØ Purpose:
    Encourage diverse feature learning
    Reduce model complexity
    Avoid stacking too many deep layers
üß† Think of it like:
    "Divide and conquer": different parts of features learn differently, then merge

‚úÖ SpaceToDepth
    A fixed, non-learned operation that rearranges spatial info into channels.

Example:
    Input: [B, C, H, W]
    SpaceToDepth(block=2) ‚Üí [B, 4C, H/2, W/2]

Key Properties:
    No parameters, not learned
    Increases channels by pulling pixels from spatial space

Often used for:
Downsampling without losing detail
Bringing fine-grain spatial info into deeper layers
Used in YOLOv4, TF object detection
Think of it as a ‚Äúreshape operation‚Äù that trades space for depth (channel)


| Feature      | `C3`                         | `C2f`                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Architecture | Dual-branch with Bottlenecks | Split-input parallel Conv blocks |
| Params/Speed | Heavier                      | Lighter, more efficient          |
| Used In      | YOLOv5                       | YOLOv8                           |

[[16, 19, 22], 1, YOLOEDetect, [nc, 512, True]]
üîç How it works:
Each input tensor from layers 16, 19, 22 is:

P3: [B, 256, 64, 64]
P4: [B, 512, 32, 32]
P5: [B, 1024, 16, 16]

Each of these is passed through a small Conv block inside YOLOEDetect, usually like:
    Conv(in_channels, 512, 1x1): FPN-style architecture
    Conv(512, anchors * (classes + 5), 1x1(kernels ))  => 5 = x, y, w, h, objectness classes = your actual class count

    ‚úÖ Final Output: Not just a single value ‚Äî it's a full feature map per scale:
    [B, anchors √ó (nc + 5), H, W] for each scale

    üîç Think of it this way:
    Instead of predicting a box from scratch, the model starts from an anchor box and learns:
        how to move (center offset: Œîx, Œîy)
        how to scale (Œîw, Œîh)
        and how likely that anchor "hits" an object (confidence)


üÜö Anchor vs. Anchor-Free (like YOLOv8):
| Aspect                    | Anchor-Based                       | Anchor-Free                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Example Models            | YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5             | YOLOv8, CenterNet, FCOS          |
| Prediction Style          | Adjust pre-defined boxes (anchors) | Directly predict box coordinates |
| Number of boxes           | More (many anchors √ó grid)         | Fewer                            |
| NMS (Non-Max Suppression) | Required                           | Still needed, but often simpler  |
| Speed                     | Slightly slower                    | Faster                           |
| Simplicity                | More complex (anchor tuning)       | Simpler pipeline                 |


Conv(in_channels, 512, kernel_size=1)
üîç Purpose of 1√ó1 Conv:
    Change the number of channels
        Like a linear projection in CNN space
    Lightweight
        1√ó1 kernels are very cheap compared to 3√ó3
    Feature mixing
        Mixes information across channels, not across spatial locations

nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(in_channels, 512, kernel_size=1, bias=False),  => [32 √ó 32 positions] √ó [1024 values per pos] √ó [512 filters] 
                                                            => (32√ó32, 1024) √ó (1024, 512) = (32√ó32, 512)
    nn.BatchNorm2d(512),
    nn.SiLU()  # or ReLU/LeakyReLU
)

| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Conv 1√ó1`   | ‚úÖ Yes                   | Reduce/increase channels, feature mix |
| `BatchNorm`  | ‚úÖ Yes                   | Normalize and stabilize               |
| `Activation` | No (but learn-friendly) | Adds nonlinearity                     |
